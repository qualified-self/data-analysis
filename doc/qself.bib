  abstract = {A new method for assessing group synchrony is introduced as being potentially useful for objectively determining degree of group cohesiveness or entitativity. The cluster-phase method of Frank and Richardson (2010) was used to analyze movement data from the rocking chair movements of six-member groups who rocked their chairs while seated in a circle facing the center. In some trials group members had no information about others' movements (their eyes were shut) or they had their eyes open and gazed at a marker in the center of the group. As predicted, the group level synchrony measure was able to distinguish between situations where synchrony would have been possible and situations where it would be impossible. Moreover, other aspects of the analysis illustrated how the cluster phase measures can be used to determine the type of patterning of group synchrony, and, when integrated with multi-level modeling, can be used to examine individual-level differences in synchrony and dyadic level synchrony as well.},

A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons.

  abstract = {Effective interpersonal coordination is fundamental to robust social interaction, and the ability to anticipate a coactor’s behavior is essential for achieving this coordination. However, coordination research has focused on the behavioral synchrony that occurs between the simple periodic movements of coactors and, thus, little is known about the anticipation that occurs during complex, everyday interaction. Research on the dynamics of coupled neurons, human motor control, electrical circuits, and laser semiconductors universally demonstrates that small temporal feedback delays are necessary for the anticipation of chaotic events. We therefore investigated whether similar feedback delays would promote anticipatory behavior during social interaction. Results revealed that coactors were not only able to anticipate others’ chaotic movements when experiencing small perceptual-motor delays, but also exhibited movement patterns of equivalent complexity. This suggests that such delays, including those within the human nervous system, may enhance, rather than hinder, the anticipatory processes that underlie successful social interaction.},

The present article reviews this process by looking at experiments that were made on fireflies and the mathematical model of Mirollo and Strogatz [1], which provides key rules to obtaining a synchronized network in a decentralized manner. This model is then applied to wireless ad hoc networks. To properly apply this model with an accuracy limited only to the propagation delay, a novel synchronization scheme, which is derived from the original firefly synchronization principle, is presented, and simulation results are given.},

However, the extent and functional significance of cardiac and respiratory between-person couplings have not been investigated thus far. Here, we report interpersonal oscillatory couplings among eleven singers and one conductor engaged in choir singing. We find that: (a) phase synchronization both in respiration and heart rate variability increase significantly during singing relative to a rest condition; (b) phase synchronization is higher when singing in unison than when singing pieces with multiple voice parts; (c) directed coupling measures are consistent with the presence of causal effects of the conductor on the singers at high modulation frequencies; (d) the different voices of the choir are reflected in network analyses of cardiac and respiratory activity based on graph theory. Our results suggest that oscillatory coupling of cardiac and respiratory patterns provide a physiological basis for interpersonal action coordination.},

  abstract = {Detecting the temporal relationship among events in the environment is a fundamental goal of the brain. Following pulses of rhythmic stimuli, neurons of the retina and cortex produce activity that closely approximates the timing of an omitted pulse. This omitted stimulus response (OSR) is generally interpreted as a transient response to rhythmic input and is thought to form a basis of short-term perceptual memories. Despite its ubiquity across species and experimental protocols, the mechanisms underlying OSRs remain poorly understood. In particular, the highly transient nature of OSRs, typically limited to a single cycle after stimulation, cannot be explained by a simple mechanism that would remain locked to the frequency of stimulation. Here, we describe a set of realistic simulations that capture OSRs over a range of stimulation frequencies matching experimental work. The model does not require an explicit mechanism for learning temporal sequences. Instead, it relies on spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a form of synaptic modification that is sensitive to the timing of pre- and post-synaptic action potentials. In the model, the transient nature of OSRs is attributed to the heterogeneous nature of neural properties and connections, creating intricate forms of activity that are continuously changing over time. Combined with STDP, neural heterogeneity enabled OSRs to complex rhythmic patterns as well as OSRs following a delay period. These results link the response of neurons to rhythmic patterns with the capacity of heterogeneous circuits to produce transient and highly flexible forms of neural activity.},

Contrary to Hopfield and Herz (1995), we find that networks of locally coupled integrate-and-fire oscillators can quickly synchronize. Furthermore, we examine the time needed to synchronize such networks. We observe that these networks synchronize at times proportional to the logarithm of their size, and we give the parameters used to control the rate of synchronization. Inspired by locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator network (LEGION) dynamics with relaxation oscillators (Terman \& Wang, 1995), we find that global inhibition can play a similar role of desynchronization in a network of integrate-and-fire oscillators. We illustrate that a LEGION architecture with integrate-and-fire oscillators can be similarly used to address image analysis.},
